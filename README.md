# EMHB Easy Medium Hard Benchmark for Long Sequence Time Series Forecasting
 
This paper introduces **E**asy **M**edium **H**ard **B**enchmark(EMHB), a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating time series forecasting models. This benchmark has been developed in response to recent advancements in deep learning methods in time series forecasting task. EMHB evaluates the performance of 14 major forecasting models on carefully designed dataset collections, including commonly used 8 datasets and 9 new datasets that we have introduced. In addition, we present a novel method to measure the quality of forecasting time series datasets, separating datasets into three collections with different forecasting difficulty: Easy, Medium and Hard. By conducting a thorough analysis of the experimental results, including the overall prediction performance of models and their generalization across different prediction lengths and datasets, we provide a comprehensive measurement of the predictive ability of current time series forecasting models. By demonstrating and analyzing the issue of forecast degradation, our findings show that error metrics alone are insufficient for evaluating these forecasting models. We also discuss the causes of forecast degradation and provide our solutions. Our EMHB will serve as a valuable resource for advancing research in time series forecasting problem.
